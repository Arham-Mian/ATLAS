Task 2 : Introduction of cloud and cloud computing 

**Cloud computing** is a technology that allows users to access and store data, applications, and services over the internet instead of on local computers or servers. It offers on-demand availability of computing resources like servers, storage, databases, networking, and software, without the need for direct management. This model provides flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency, making it ideal for individuals and businesses. The "cloud" refers to a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to manage, process, and store data.
